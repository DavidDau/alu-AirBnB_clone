# AirBnB Clone - Command Interpreter

***Description***:
This project is the first step towards creating a clone of the popular AirBnB web application. We start by building a command-line interface (CLI) that will allow us to manage different objects in the AirBnB environment. This includes tasks such as creating, modifying, and deleting objects (e.g., User, City, Place) and storing their state in a file.

This command interpreter is crucial as it will be used in future steps to integrate the application with a web interface, a database, and APIs. Our goal is to build a functional, modular application that scales as additional components are added.

# Command Interpreter

The command interpreter acts as a limited-use shell for managing AirBnB objects, following the pattern of:

- Create new objects.
- Retrieve objects from storage.
- Perform operations (count, compute stats).
- Update object attributes.
- Delete objects.

# How to Start the Command Interpreter

Clone the repository: <br>bash <br>Copy code: <br>git clone https://github.com/DavidDau/AirBnB_clone.git

1. Make the console script executable:<br>bash<br>Copy code _chmod +x console.py_

2. Run the command interpreter in interactive mode:<br>bash<br>Copy code _./console.py_

You can also run it in non-interactive mode by echoing commands:<br>bash<br>Copy code _echo "help" | ./console.py_

# How to Use the Command Interpreter

Once inside the command interpreter (in interactive mode), you can run several commands:

<br>**help**: Displays the list of commands or provides help for a specific command.
<br>
bash
<br>
Copy code
<br>
_help_
<br>
_Documented commands (type help ):_
<br>
_EOF help quit_

<br>create <class>: Creates a new object of the specified class (e.g., User, City).
<br>
bash
<br>
Copy code
<br>
_create User_

show <class> <id>: Shows the details of a specific object based on its class and ID.
<br>
bash
<br>
Copy code
<br>
_show User 1234-1234-1234_

destroy <class> <id>: Deletes a specified object.
<br>
bash
<br>
Copy code
<br>
_destroy User 1234-1234-1234_

all [<class>]: Shows all objects or all objects of a specific class.
<br>
bash
<br>
Copy code
<br>
_all_
<br>
_all User_
<br>
_update <class> <id> <attribute_name> <attribute_value>: Updates the attributes of a specific object._
<br>
bash
<br>
Copy code
<br>
_update User 1234-1234-1234 email "newemail@example.com"_

quit: Exits the command interpreter.

# Examples

Interactive mode:
<br>
bash
<br>
Copy code
<br>
_$ ./console.py_
<br>
_help_
<br>
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
<br>
EOF help quit
<br>
_create User_
<br>
_1234-5678-9012_
<br>
_show User 1234-5678-9012_

[User] (1234-5678-9012) {'id': '1234-5678-9012', 'created_at': '2024-09-09T00:00:00', ...}
<br>
_quit_
<br>
$

Non-interactive mode:
<br>
bash
<br>
Copy code
<br>
_$ echo "create User" | ./console.py_
<br>
_1234-5678-9012_
<br>
_$_

# Project Structure

The project includes the following key components:<br>

- **BaseModel:** The parent class that handles initialization, serialization, and deserialization of objects.
- **User, State, City, Place, etc.:** Classes that inherit from BaseModel and represent AirBnB entities.
- **FileStorage:** The storage engine that serializes objects to and deserializes objects from a JSON file.
- **Unit Tests:** Located in the tests/ directory to ensure the correct functionality of all components.
